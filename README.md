# hello-world
The first repository I have created on GitHub

I do a PhD in economics at Bonn University. Hope I finally get my code organized and properly sinchronised between machines since I've turned to GitHup repository practice.

I've never tried Moon tacos, but I bet that my cooking is better =))
